# Video-Summarization
We created a pipeline that takes a video as an input, passes it on to 2 different models for video details extraction and the other for Audio Detail extraction, both the outputs are merged using falcons ai - text summarizer, that's returned as the final output. We finally built an interactive UI using React and Cursor AI
